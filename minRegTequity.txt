
I’ll explain how things work now and then a little background.  I created the scenario you describe in account 4ZE87065 in prodfix. The account has

3200 margin balance
1000 option requirement 
------
2200 house cash excess and starting cash BP, and starting CATW
4400 margin BP

3200 margin RegT equity
2300 net liq value
300 actual CATW


For buying power, the 2,200 is displayed for Cash BP. We do show a warning (see other screenshot) if the result of an order will being the account below 2000 RegT equity.  It’s not an order rejection, just a warning. 

I do see what you mean about possibly displaying 1200 as the cash option buying power, but I have also heard some debate about that.  There’s a case made that the account actually has 2200 to spend, and that they should be allowed to spend it.  Also, people seem to prefer to have Margin BP always displayed as 2x Cash BP, and showing 1200 as cash BP would not change 4400 as margin BP, so that it would “look” strange.  Anyway, that’s why the warning message is there, because it allows the account to trade all of their excess, but still let them know the order is going to cause RegT equity to drop below 2000.  Presumably the account holder saw the warning message, and will liquidate something before the end of the day to bring the number back above 2000, or they will be okay with the min equity call. 

Before the Feb 2016 changes, there were times when cash BP was less than one-half of margin BP, to try and preserve the 2000 RegT equity. And, margin-eligibility was based on RegT equity.  But there were ways that the account could still trade and fall below 2000 RegT equity, then all of the sudden their existing positions got margined at 100% and all the account’s buying power would get wiped out, until they liquidated enough options to bring the RegT equity above 2000 again. 

The changes for Feb 2016 also made the account’s margin-eligibility based on starting net liq, not on real-time margin RegT equity.  That resolved the issue where accounts would have large swings in buying power if they were right around 2000 of RegT equity.  But that also made CATW different.  The available CATW is now intended to preserve 2000 of net liq, not equity.   The net liq value at the time of the screenshot was 2300, therefore the available CATW would be 300. Note that available CATW would change based on market prices through the day. 

From my standpoint, I don’t much mind how it works, but I do think that the margin calculations suffer from the common theme that there’s not enough information on the screen to tell exactly how the calculations are made.  The calculations can be anything that the business wants, but it should always be clear to the customer.  For example, the available CATW really could use a footnote next to it explaining that the account must keep a minimum 2000 net liq value to maintain margin eligibility because it holds a short spread.  Naturally if the account didn’t hold that short spread, then the CATW would be equal to the house cash excess.

This is brilliant, Jason! Thanks so much! 


ET uses different calculations for all of the different buying power. They also distinguish between what kind of buying power PDT and non-PDT accounts are granted. 

They also use “real time” margin equity (as opposed to start of day NLV, which is the correct way to do it) to allow or disallow spreads with requirements and short stock (like TM, they will allow debit spreads, which, as we all know, is wrong). I have pointed out to them the flaw using real-time, as you did below, and the confusion that will bring, but that’s how they do it.

Here is their BP:

Non-PDT

Cash buying power         = MIN(SMA. House Excess)
ONBP                                    =MIN(SMA * 2, House Excess * 4)
DT BP                                    = N/A (they do not grant DT BP to non-PDT accounts)

Back to margin BP

In addition to the SMA and excess calcs, they have a 3rd determinant, they call it “Special Condition for <$2K”. 

“Special Condition for <$2K”.

IF account is <$2K,
AND No option requirement or short MV stock exist,
THEN
                Margin BP = Type 1 cash + any cash credit (cash available for investment or margin balance)
ELSE If account <$2K
AND Option requirement or Short MV stock exist,
THEN
                Margin BP = Reg T Equity - $2,000

So, ONBP is actually ONBP           =MIN(SMA * 2, House Excess * 4, special condition <$2K)

Also, they will not allow an account to drop below $2,000 minimum margin equity.

So, back to my example. In this case ET will display $1,200 for cash BP, and 4x house excess (we are assuming inflated SMA) or $8,800.

So I hear you, that there is a disconnect in the buying power numbers (our accounts are used to ONBP = 2x cash BP) but that will be going away (in most accounts I may add, since they will be importing Apex SMA numbers).

When an account has inflated SMA they will see margin BP = 4x house excess.

PDT

Cash buying power         = MIN(SMA. House Excess)
ONBP                                    =MIN(SMA * 2, House Excess * 4)
DT BP                                    = 4x NYSE minimum requirement 

Take a look at this account:

5QD34728 May

OptionsHouse BP numbers

Cash BP                                = $324,750.35 (equal to house excess)
ONBP                                    = $649,500.70 (2x excess)
DT BP                                    = $1,299,001.40 (4x excess)

The account has SMA at Apex equal to $1,393,526.02. Also, this account is holding a large position in RUBI which has a 60% requirement and also a smaller position in LYG at 50%. NYSE minimum requirement is $607,635.69 less than house requirements.

ET buying power numbers

Cash BP                                = $324,750.35 (equal to house excess)
ONBP                                    = $1,299,001.40 (equal to 4x house excess, which is less than 2x SMA)
DT BP                                    = $3,729,544.16 (equal to 4x NYSE minimums)

Pretty big differences! Our customers heads will be spinning!! Trust me on this, I’ve run the numbers, with the inflated Apex SMA, our accounts are going to see SIZABLE increases in ONBP, and obviously, day trading buying power. The non-PDT accounts will “lose” their day trading buying power, but the fact of the matter is most of them will see ONBP equal to their current 4x.

In addition, the PDT accounts can use all of their day trading buying power to buy higher-requirement stocks. Let’s say this account wanted to buy more RUBI.

He could spend all the day trading buying power to buy it! He doesn’t have to put up 60%, he can buy it at 25%.

The non-PDT will have to put up 60%, so he could only use cash BP/.60 to determine how much he can spend.


What do you think?
